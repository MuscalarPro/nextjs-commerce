    <h2>Terms of Sale</h2>
    <p>All products offered for sale by Muscalar Pro are subject to availability and we reserve the right to impose quantity limits on any order or reject all or any part of an order without prior notice. In the event of an error, we reserve the right to correct the error and revise your order accordingly (which includes charging the correct price) or to cancel the order and refund any amount charged.

You are responsible for any applicable Goods and Services Tax (GST), customs duty, or other governmental taxes, levies or fees ("Taxes") due with respect to your purchase of products or services through our Services. We will collect applicable Taxes if we determine we have a duty to collect Taxes. We will present an estimate of Taxes we collect at checkout, except where we have clearly stated in writing that a price includes Taxes. The actual Taxes charged may be adjusted from the amount shown at checkout. Several factors may cause this, such as variances between processor programs and changes in tax rates.</p>
    <p>If any of the products in your order are unavailable, we will only charge the prices, Taxes, and other applicable charges associated with the products that are included in the shipment. You agree to pay any shipping and handling charges, if any, shown at the time you make a purchase. We reserve the right to increase, decrease, add, or eliminate shipping and handling charges from time to time, but we will provide notice of the changes applicable to you before you make your purchase.

Unless we state otherwise in writing via the Services, risk of loss or damage to a product passes to you upon delivery of the product to our designated carrier.</p>
    <p>In connection with any purchase you make through the Service, you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to the transaction, including, without limitation, your payment details, your billing address, your shipping address, your phone number and/or your email address. By submitting such information, you grant Muscalar Pro without charge the irrevocable, unencumbered, worldwide and perpetual right to provide such information to third parties (e.g., payment processing companies, logistics and fulfilment partners) for the purpose of facilitating the transaction.</p>
    <p>All credit card, debit card, UPI, net banking, wallet, and other monetary transactions on or through the Services occur through a third-party online payment processing application(s) accessible through the Services, in compliance with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines and the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007. Muscalar Pro's third-party payment processor is in no way subject to Muscalar Pro's direction or control; thus, their relationship is not, and should not be construed as, one of fiduciaries, franchisors-franchisees, agents-principals, employers-employees, partners, joint venturers or the like.</p>

    <h2>Notices</h2>
    <p>Any notices to you from Muscalar Pro regarding the Services or this Agreement may be made by email, a posted notice on the Platform, SMS, WhatsApp, or regular mail, in the sole discretion of Muscalar Pro.</p>

    <h2>Entire Agreement</h2>
    <p>This Agreement and any other agreements Muscalar Pro may post on the Services constitute the entire agreement between Muscalar Pro and you in connection with your use of the Services and supersede any prior agreements between Muscalar Pro and you regarding use of the Services, including prior versions of this Agreement.</p>

    <h2>Binding Arbitration / Class Waiver</h2>
    <p>YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT ANY LEGAL CLAIM, DISPUTE OR OTHER CONTROVERSY BETWEEN YOU AND MUSCALAR PRO ARISING OUT OF OR OTHERWISE RELATING IN ANY WAY TO MUSCALAR PRO, THE PLATFORM, THE CONTENT OR THE SERVICES, OR ANY OTHER MUSCALAR PRO GOODS, SERVICES OR ADVERTISING, INCLUDING CONTROVERSIES RELATING TO THE APPLICABILITY, ENFORCEABILITY OR VALIDITY OF ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT (COLLECTIVELY "DISPUTES"), SHALL BE RESOLVED IN CONFIDENTIAL BINDING ARBITRATION CONDUCTED BEFORE A SOLE ARBITRATOR APPOINTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ARBITRATION AND CONCILIATION ACT, 1996 (AS AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME) ("ARBITRATION ACT"), RATHER THAN IN A COURT, AS DESCRIBED HEREIN. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE VOLUNTARILY AND KNOWINGLY FORFEITING YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR COURT, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN.</p>
    <p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and judicial review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual.</p>
    <p>Payment of arbitration costs will be governed by the applicable fee schedule under the Arbitration Act or the rules of the arbitral institution selected by the parties, unless you are able to show that your portion will be prohibitive as compared to litigation costs, in which case Muscalar Pro will pay as much of your arbitration costs as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to litigation costs. Muscalar Pro also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all arbitration costs. Each party agrees to pay its own advocates' fees and expenses unless there is a governing statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid advocates' fees and expenses.</p>
    <p>The arbitration shall be conducted in Bangalore, Karnataka, India, except that, in the event Bangalore is not within reasonable proximity of your residence, the arbitration may be conducted virtually via video conferencing. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding on all parties and may be entered as a decree in any court of competent jurisdiction under Section 36 of the Arbitration Act.</p>
    <p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the extent the Dispute arises from: (a) a violation of either party's intellectual property rights in any manner; (b) any claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, unauthorised use or a violation of the Information Technology Act, 2000; and/or (c) any claim for equitable relief, then you and Muscalar Pro agree that a party may seek injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in a competent court in Bangalore, Karnataka, India, and both parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts in connection with such proceedings. In addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual action in a consumer forum or district court for Disputes that are within the scope of such forum's or court's jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration as long as such action remains in such forum or court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.</p>
    <p>ALL DISPUTES SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. NO PARTY MAY BRING ANY CLAIM SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, OR AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS PROCEEDING. THE CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE JOINED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE CONSOLIDATED OR JOINED WITH ANY OTHER ARBITRATION. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOUR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim or request for relief, then such claim or request for relief (and only that claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be brought exclusively in the competent courts located in Bangalore, Karnataka, India, subject to the parties' respective rights to appeal the decision. All other claims or requests for relief shall be arbitrated. The parties agree that any claims or requests for relief that are severed from an arbitration may not proceed in litigation and shall be stayed until all claims between the parties remaining in arbitration are finally resolved. The parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Bangalore, Karnataka, India for purposes of resolving any claims or requests for relief severed from arbitration pursuant to this paragraph.</p>
    <p>You can opt out of the provisions of this Agreement that require the arbitration of Disputes within 30 days of the date that you first agree to any version of this Agreement that requires arbitration of disputes with Muscalar Pro. To opt out, you must send your name, residence address, and email address together with a clear statement that you want to opt out of the requirement to arbitrate disputes with Muscalar Pro to: <a href="mailto:support@muscularpro.com">support@muscularpro.com</a>, ATTN: Arbitration Opt-Out.</p>
    <p>Before you commence arbitration of a Dispute, you must provide us with a written Notice of Dispute that includes your name, residence address, username (if applicable), and email address associated with your User account (if applicable), a detailed description of the Dispute, and the relief you seek. Before we commence arbitration of a Dispute against you, we will provide a written Notice of Dispute to you with a detailed description of the Dispute and the relief we seek. Any Notice of Dispute you send to us should be emailed to <a href="mailto:support@muscularpro.com">support@muscularpro.com</a>, ATTN: Dispute Notice. If we are unable to resolve a Dispute within 30 days after the applicable Notice of Dispute is received, either party may commence arbitration. If we make any future material changes to the provisions of this Agreement that govern the arbitration or resolution of Disputes, you may reject such changes by sending a written notice of your rejection decision to us at <a href="mailto:support@muscularpro.com">support@muscularpro.com</a>, ATTN: Arbitration Opt-Out, within 30 days of the effective date of such modifications.</p>

    <h2>Governing Law; Venue; Severability of Provisions</h2>
    <p>Services are controlled and operated by Muscalar Pro from our offices within India. Those who choose to access the Services from other locations do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent applicable. Access to the Services from jurisdictions where the contents of the Services are illegal or penalised is prohibited.</p>
    <p>The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement will be governed by the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for arbitration-related matters) and the laws of India, without regard to any conflicts of law provisions. The courts of competent jurisdiction in Bangalore, Karnataka, India shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all matters arising out of or in connection with this Agreement that are not subject to arbitration.</p>
    <p>All parts of this Agreement apply to the maximum extent permitted by law. Our failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right. We both agree that if we cannot enforce a part of this Agreement as written, then that part will be replaced with terms that most closely match the intent of the unenforceable part to the extent permitted by law. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the invalidity of part of this Agreement will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions. The section headings are for convenience and do not have any force or effect.</p>

    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>You may not assign or transfer any of your rights or obligations under this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. Any attempt to assign or transfer this Agreement without such consent will be null and void. Muscalar Pro may, in its sole discretion, assign or transfer its rights and obligations under this Agreement without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors, and permitted assigns.</p>
