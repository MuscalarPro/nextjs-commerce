    <h1>MUSCALAR PRO M3 — Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated and Effective: 17.02.2026</p>

    <p>Muscalar Pro Health Private Limited ("MUSCALAR PRO," "we," "our," or "us") owns and operates the website (the "Website") located at muscularpro.com and other related websites and platforms and may own and/or operate a "MUSCALAR PRO" mobile application (collectively, the "Platform"). Your access and use of the Platform, any part thereof, or anything associated therewith, including its content ("Content"), any products or services provided through the Platform or Website or otherwise by MUSCALAR PRO, and any affiliated website, software or application owned or operated by MUSCALAR PRO (collectively, the "Services") are subject to this Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") unless specifically stated otherwise. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy have the same meaning as set forth in the Terms of Service ("Terms of Service").</p>

    <p>In keeping with this commitment, this Privacy Policy describes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Personal Information that we receive from you when you interact with the Services</li>
      <li>How we use and process the Personal Information that we receive</li>
      <li>If and why Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties</li>
      <li>Your choices regarding the collection and processing of your Personal Information</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When you access the Services or send your Personal Information to us via email, text messages, or other electronic messages, you consent to receive communications from us, in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. If you don't agree with this Privacy Policy, do not use our Services. By accessing or using our Services, you agree that you have read this Privacy Policy and you understand, and consent to be bound by, the terms and conditions herein. If you have not done so already, please also review our Terms of Service. The Terms of Service contain provisions that limit our liability to you. If you are using the Services on behalf of an individual other than yourself, you represent that you are authorized by such individual to act on such individual's behalf and that such individual acknowledges and agrees to the terms and conditions herein.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy and Notifications</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time. We will notify you and/or require you to accept the updated Privacy Policy only if the supplemented, amended or otherwise modified Privacy Policy implements material changes from MUSCALAR PRO's then-current Privacy Policy. It is your responsibility to carefully review this Privacy Policy each time you visit, access or use the Service.</p>

    <p>MUSCALAR PRO may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to this Agreement, using any reasonable means now known or hereafter developed, including by email, regular mail, SMS, MMS, text message or postings on the Website or Platform. Such notices may not be received if you violate this Agreement by accessing the Website or Platform in an unauthorized manner. You agree that you are deemed to have received any and all notices that would have been delivered had you accessed the Services in an authorized manner. We will not make retroactive changes that reduce your privacy rights unless we are legally required to do so. Your continued use of our Services after we make changes shall constitute your acceptance of those changes, so please check this Privacy Policy periodically for updates. The amended Privacy Policy supersedes all previous versions.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect About You</h2>
    <p>The Personal Information we collect depends on how you interact with us, the portions of the Service you use, and the choices you make.
